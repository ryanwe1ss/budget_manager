# Pseudo-code Overview

## Data Models

**Brand**
- Has a daily and monthly budget
- Tracks daily_spend and monthly_spend
- Can have many campaigns

**Campaign**
- Belongs to a brand
- Has its own spend (today + this month)
- Can be active or paused
- Connected to a dayparting schedule (optional)

**DaypartingSchedule**
- Tied to one campaign
- Has a start_hour and end_hour (e.g. 9 to 17)

**SpendLog**
- Tracks how much a campaign spends at a given time
- Used to simulate or record spending

---

## Key Logic

### Spend Tracking
- When a campaign spends, we create a `SpendLog`
- That amount is added to:
  - The campaign’s spend_today and spend_this_month
  - The brand’s daily_spend and monthly_spend

### Budget Enforcement
- Every hour:
  - If a brand is over daily or monthly budget, pause its campaigns

### Dayparting
- Every hour:
  - Check each campaign's schedule
  - If current time is outside allowed hours, pause it
  - If time is inside and budgets are OK, activate it

### Daily + Monthly Resets
- Every night at midnight:
  - Reset brand daily_spend and campaign spend_today
  - Reactivate all campaigns that are within budget
- On the 1st of every month:
  - Reset brand monthly_spend and campaign spend_this_month
  - Reactivate eligible campaigns
